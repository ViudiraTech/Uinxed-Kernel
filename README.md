## Overview 💡

Uinxed-Kernel is a Unix-like operating system kernel developed from scratch, focusing on modern computer architecture and advanced system design concepts. The project aims to build an efficient, stable, and scalable operating system kernel while maintaining code clarity and maintainability.

## Core Features 🌟

- **x86_64 architecture support**: optimized for modern 64-bit x86 processors
- **UEFI boot**: uses UEFI as the boot mode to support modern hardware platforms
- **Legacy boot**: Compatible with traditional Legacy boot
- **KASLR**: Kernel address space layout randomization to enhance security.
- **Memory management**:
  - Physical memory frame allocator
  - Virtual memory page management
  - High half memory mapping (HHDM)
- **Interrupt management**:
  - Complete interrupt descriptor table (IDT) implementation
  - Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) support
- **System management**:
  - ACPI support
  - High Precision Event Timer (HPET)
  - Multi-core support based on symmetric multi-processing
- **Terminal meatures**:
  - Pure TTF fonts
  - High-speed terminal implementation

## Development environment preparation 🛠️

### Required Tools

1. **make**: Used to build projects.
2. **gcc**: GCC Version 13.3.0+ is recommended.
3. **qemu**: Used for simulation testing.
4. **xorriso**: Used to build ISO image files.
5. **clang-format**: Used to format the code.
6. **clang-tidy**: Used for static analysis of code.
7. **kconfig-frontends**: Provides a graphical configuration menu.
8. **libncurses-dev**: Text-based user interface library.

### Installation Steps

**Debian & Ubuntu & Kali**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make gcc qemu-system xorriso clang-format clang-tidy kconfig-frontends libncurses-dev
```

**ArchLinux**
```bash
pacman -Sy make gcc qemu-system xorriso clang-format clang-tidy kconfig-frontends libncurses-dev
```

**Alpine**
```bash
sudo apk update
sudo apk add make gcc qemu-system xorriso clang-format clang-tidy kconfig-frontends libncurses-dev
```

## Compilation Guide 📖

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViudiraTech/Uinxed-Kernel.git
cd Uinxed-Kernel
```

### Start Compiling

```bash
make
```

## Running Tests 🏃‍♂️

### Virtual machine running

```bash
make run
```

### Physical machine operation

#### Boot in UEFI mode

1. Convert the USB drive or hard disk to GPT partition table and create ESP partition.
2. Copy all folders under the project directory ./assets/Limine to the ESP partition.
3. Copy the compiled kernel (UxImage) to the ./EFI/Boot/ directory in the ESP partition.
4. Boot from a physical machine (must be in 64-bit UEFI mode with CSM disabled)

#### Boot in legacy mode

Direct boot:

1. Burn the ISO image to your drive.
2. Boot from a physical machine (at least a 64-bit machine)

Boot with ventoy:

1. Copy the ISO image to your drive.
2. Boot from your drive and enter in ventoy.
3. Select the image then press enter, boot in normal mode or memdisk mode.

## FAQ 🔍

### Errors about "'XXX.h' file not found" in editors.

A: If you are using clangd as a code analyzer, you can generate a .clangd file via Makefile. Just like this:

```bash
make gen.clangd
```

However, if you are using a different LSP server, you can refer to the Makefile to change your configuration file.

### How to format the code?

A: Make sure you have clang-format installed, then execute make format. Just like this:

```bash
make format
```

### How to statically check code?

A: Make sure clang-tidy is installed, and then execute make check as follows:

```bash
make check
```

## Contribution Guide 🤝

## Submit an issue ❓

Communication is the key to problem solving. When you encounter a bug, you can report it to us by submitting an issue.
We welcome everyone to submit an issue. But before you do it, you should know our rule of submitting.

1. **Describe the problem in as much detail as possible.**
It will help us understand clearly what happened. For this, you may submit with your log or code snippet.
2. **Just be polite.**
Bring your problem politely. Asking questions to us in an extremely impolite manner will not solve any substantive problems, but will instead cause both the questioner and the answerer to engage in a fight. Asking questions politely and rationally will help solve the problem smoothly.
3. **No need to worry about being formal.**
You can be more casual, no need to be too formal. It is because of your questions that we can make our project better, so in a sense we are partners. On the other hand, because the language is too formal, it may be difficult to read. In order to maximize efficiency, we do not require formal language.
4. **Native language allowed.**
You can submit an issue in your own language. However, please be aware of factors such as spelling that may affect the translation results, and sometimes the translator may not work well because of this.
